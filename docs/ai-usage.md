# AI usage

## Sprint #0

We used AI during creation of the script for the first week as a helper tool to bootstrap the basic structure and
questions, which we further elicitated ourselves. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

## Sprint #1

To complete this assignment, an AI model was utilized primarily as an assistant for drafting, refinement, and
formatting. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

- Interview Script Preparation: The initial draft of the customer interview script, including its basic structure and a
  set of foundational questions, was generated using the AI model. This provided a starting point which was then
  personally reviewed, polished, and expanded upon to better fit the specific context of the assignment.
- Content Polishing: The AI was also employed to refine the descriptions for the Quality Attributes and the Tech Stack.
  This involved using the model to help improve clarity, conciseness, and professional wording.
- Markdown Formatting: Finally, the AI assisted in beautifying and structuring the overall document using Markdown,
  ensuring a clean and readable final presentation.
