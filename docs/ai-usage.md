# AI usage

## Sprint #0

We used AI during creation of the script for the first week as a helper tool to bootstrap the basic structure and
questions, which we further elicitated ourselves. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

## Sprint #1

To complete this assignment, an AI model was utilized primarily as an assistant for drafting, refinement, and
formatting. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

- Interview Script Preparation: The initial draft of the customer interview script, including its basic structure and a
  set of foundational questions, was generated using the AI model. This provided a starting point which was then
  personally reviewed, polished, and expanded upon to better fit the specific context of the assignment.
- Interview Meeting Summarization: The meeting was recorded, the the auidio file was converted by AI into meeting summary.
- Content Polishing: The AI was also employed to refine the descriptions for the Quality Attributes and the Tech Stack.
  This involved using the model to help improve clarity, conciseness, and professional wording.
- Markdown Formatting: Finally, the AI assisted in beautifying and structuring the overall document using Markdown,
  ensuring a clean and readable final presentation.

## Sprint #2

In Sprint #2, AI was utilized as an assistant for processing meeting audio, drafting initial documentation, and refining content based on stakeholder feedback. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

- Meeting Summarization and Drafting: Audio files from two customer meetings were processed by the AI to help draft meeting summaries and extract key action points. This provided a foundation for our final meeting-1.md file.
- Documentation Support: The AI was used to help structure and draft initial versions of complex documents based on our prompts. This included the CONTRIBUTING.md file, the 'Design Decisions' table for our architecture, and new sections for our docs/plan.md.
- Retrospective Assistance: We used the AI to help structure our retrospective.md file, providing a clear template for our successes, problems, and actionable changes, which we then filled in with our own analysis.
- Markdown Formatting: As with the previous sprint, the AI was used to help format our documentation for clarity, readability, and consistency in Markdown.
