# Interview script

### 1. Review Action Points from Last Meeting

* In our last meeting, we agreed to prioritize getting a fully functional version deployed.
* We are happy to report that the Production environment is live and stable.

### 2. Show Deployed Production Solution

* **Objective:** Show the core grading workflow on the live system [my.innopolis.university](https://my.innopolis.university).
* "We will demonstrate the Professor workflow directly on the production server."
* "We will select a group, enter grades for an assignment, and save the changes."
* "Then, we will log in as a student to verify that the grades appear correctly and privately."

### 4. Technical Demo: Monitoring & Observability

* Since we are now moving to active use, we have implemented a robust monitoring stack to ensure stability.
* We'd like to show you our Victoria Logs, Victoria Metrics and Grafana dashboard connected to the production system.
* This allows us to collect logs and metrics in real-time. If a user faces a problem (like a crash or slow loading), we can see it here immediately and fix it, often before you even report it.

### 4. Clarify Next Milestone (Scope & Timeline)

*When should we schedule the delivery of this next feature?

### 5. Agree on Further Steps
* We will deliver the [Selected Feature] by [Date].
