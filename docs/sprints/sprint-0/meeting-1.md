## Meeting summary
Product should be a simplified LMS for ITPD course.

For now grades are managed in Google Spreadsheet, because in the university official resource (Moodle) it’s hard to configure. The main problem faced by the customer is that it is hard to track individual and group progress simultaneously and that TAs need to share it with students, but with limited accessibility.

The new system should support main grading functionality and be simple to use, and also provide a way for students to see their individual scores (students should not see individual grades of other students, which is hard to manage in Google Spreadsheet). Students should be able to: upload submissions, see individual grades, see their group grades, peer review other submissions. TAs can: create assignments, grade it (assign individual and group scores), assign groups for peer review, see all grades in simple format. A teacher has all TA abilities, and can assign TA for the course.

The customer said that it will be great if the product will be integrated in the existing university student portal (my.innopolis.university) and use the university Single Sign-On feature. It also will be great to connect with the Moodle API, so students and teachers do not need to upload data in both systems.
