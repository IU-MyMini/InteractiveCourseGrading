## Understanding the Course
- How many assignments or sections do you run each semester?
- How many TAs (Teaching Assistants) usually work on the course?
## The Current Grading Process
- Can you walk me through the grading process step-by-step? (From when a student submits an assignment to when their final grade is in the tracking system.)
- When a TA is grading, what's the most annoying or time-consuming part of entering that score into the spreadsheet?
- How often do students ask TAs, "What's my grade so far?"
## Problems & Past Failures
- Tell me about the last time the spreadsheet broke or caused a big mistake. What happened?
- You mentioned "individual scores are missing". What does that mean exactly?
## Requirements for the New System
- Should the new app handle all the grading and feedback, or just track the final scores and student progress?
- In the current spreadsheet, what information must be kept private from students? Why?
- Is there any must-have feature from the current spreadsheet that we absolutely must copy into the new system?
- What type of exporting/importing system you need, or just a file (like a CSV) will be enough?
## Reports & Measuring Success
- What charts or reports do you build manually right now that you wish the new system could create for you instantly?
- If the new system is working perfectly, what's the first number you'd look at to know it's running smoothly?
## Other People to Talk To
- Besides you, who else feels the pain of using this spreadsheet every day?
- Are other courses facing this same problem?

We used "The Mom Test" method, which meant we stopped asking about hypothetical "wants" or "feelings" and instead asked about specific past actions and firm constraints, like grading speed. We had customers describe the last time they did a painful task and what success absolutely required. This approach gave us concrete, actionable evidence instead of just compliments.
