### Meeting Summary

The team met with the customer to review the deployed grading table and define the final requirements for the upcoming MVP release.

**1. Demo of Grading Table**
The team demonstrated the live, deployed version of the grading table. The customer reviewed the implementation and confirmed that everything is okay regarding the current layout.

- The "Group-first" view functions correctly.
- The separation of "Group Grade" and "Individual Grade" columns meets the requirements discussed in previous meetings.

**2. Next Milestone: Student View**
The customer selected the **Student View** as the priority feature for the next implementation. To ensure the system is usable for the current course, the team must focus on enabling students to log in and view their specific grades.

**3. MVP Definition & Hard Deadline**
The customer set a hard deadline of December 1st for the production release.

- **Goal:** The system must be ready for actual use in the course by this date.
- **MVP Scope:**
 - **Teacher Side:** Full ability to input and manage grades (Group and Individual) via the grading table.
 - **Student Side:** Ability to log in and view their own grades (Group and Individual).
 - **Deployment:** The solution must be deployed ASAP to the production environment to ensure stability before the deadline.
