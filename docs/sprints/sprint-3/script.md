# Interview script

### 1. Review Action Points from Last Meeting
* In our last meeting, your top priority was to get access to the staging environment to 'click around'.
* We gave the login credentials as discussed.
* Were you able to log in, and did you encounter any immediate stability issues?

### 2. Show Deployed Solution (Grading Table)

Today we want to show you the working deployed solution. We have moved from the Figma prototype to the actual live implementation of the Grading Table. Please verify if this matches the layout decisions we made previously:
- Group-First View: "Does the table default to the list of groups as requested?"
- Expansion: "Can you successfully expand a group to see the individual students?"
- Columns: "We implemented the two separate columns you requested: 'Group Grade' and 'Individual Grade'."

### 3. Show Deployed Version
* "We have successfully deployed the first version of our module to the university's staging (test) server."
* "Right now, it's just the container, and the API endpoints are not live, but the service is running."

### 4. Clarify Next Milestone (Scope & Timeline)

- Now that the grading table structure is live, we need to decide on the delivery for the next milestone.
- When should we schedule the delivery of this next feature?

### 5. Agree on Further Steps
* We will fix any bugs you identify in the current grading table.
* We will deliver the [Selected Feature] by [Date].
